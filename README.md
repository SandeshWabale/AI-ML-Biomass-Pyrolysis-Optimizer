## 🔬 Bridging Chemical Engineering & Machine Learning

Pyrolysis is a nonlinear thermochemical process where product distribution depends on multiple interacting variables such as temperature, heating rate, and feedstock composition.

Traditional modeling approaches rely on:

- Experimental trial-and-error  
- Empirical correlations  
- Complex kinetic simulations  

This project introduces a data-driven alternative:

1. Experimental pyrolysis data is used to train a machine learning model.
2. The model learns nonlinear relationships between:
   - Biomass composition  
   - Operating parameters  
   - Product yields  
3. A global optimization algorithm searches for operating conditions that maximize a selected yield phase.

This creates a hybrid framework:

**Chemical Process Understanding  
+ Machine Learning Prediction  
+ Global Optimization  
= Intelligent Process Optimization**

The result is a computationally efficient system that approximates complex reaction behavior and supports engineering decision-making.
